# Installation recommendations

Fonts in `Recursive_Desktop` and `Recursive_Code` are made so that it is possible to install all of these without experiencing conflicts in font menus. However, you may want to pick-and-choose which font files you wish to install, based on your needs.

## General Desktop use (Word, PowerPoint, Keynote, InDesign, Illustrator, PhotoShop, etc)

- On Windows, install `Recursive_Desktop/recursive-statics.ttc` (This is a collection of all 64 static instances in TTF format)
- On Mac, install `Recursive_Desktop/recursive-statics.otc` (This is a collection of all 64 static instances in OTF format)

## Desktop web design (Sketch) & experimental use in Adobe apps

- Install `Recursive_Desktop/Recursive_VF_1.0XX.ttf` (this is the full Recursive variable font)
- It may also be beneficial to install static fonts, as OS & app support of variable fonts is still growing

## Alternative to OTC/TTC, better for Figma app and for older systems

Some people prefer to instead install individual static fonts, and this works better in certain software currently, such as Figma (see https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive/issues/339).

For these cases, you can instead install fonts from `separate_OTF_TTF_statics`.
