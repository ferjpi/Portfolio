          I’m the kind of person that always is listening to music but can’t
          sing o play any instrument. In my free time, I like to go to the
          movies or stay at home watching a good TV Show. In-person I’m a little
          shy but I like to meet new people, though.

        <span className="about_me_question__description">
          I’m a mining engineer and I worked as Operational Engineer for A
          little more than one year. I always feel an interest about technology
          and how things works, that's why I started learning about programming
          language. My First approach was with Python, then with HTML5, CSS3 and
          JavaScript. My strengths are in front end development working with
          JavaScript by my side but that doesn't mean that I haven't work with
          NodeJs. I also had work with Ruby and ROR. I'm always trying to stay
          updated in the new technologies and better practices.
