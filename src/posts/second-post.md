Hi! my name is Fernando. If you're here it means that you know who I am or a least I hope. However, I'm going to introduce my self.

I'm a Frontend developer from Colombia with a degree in Mining Engineer. Initially, I thought that was a little weird, a Mining Engineer working as a programmer but when I started talking with other developers I realize that I wasn't the only one with a different background. That made me feel good.

I consider myself a passionate person for movies and TV shows. I spend most of my time in those activities. Another passion that I have is music. I don't sing or play any instrument but I love to listen music of any kind.

```javascript
const test = () => {
  console.log("hey")
}
```
